# Large Scale Web Applications Final Project
By Dana Kirsanov, Greg Johnson, Anhad Arora, and Emily Hayashi Groves

Our web app is a renting app that lets users sign up/register and list items they would like other to rent. Those looking to rent an item can browse and view the current listings. They can also click on the user who listed them to see their profile, and all the items they currently have listed. 
If a user is interested in a specific item they can go to the item's page and fill out a contact form. The form will send the owner of the item an email, through which s/he can reply to the enquirer and work out the details of the transaction. 

A user can also view their own profile by clicking on the “My Profile” button. They can view their own information and listings, as well as select listing they would like to mark as being rented (which will remove them from the home page), and can then mark them as returned to get the item back on the market. Users can also permanently delete a listing if they do not wish to rent the item anymore.

On the home page, users can search for specific items they are interested in by the item’s name and description. The search is implemented with an RPC and Whoosh for Python.
